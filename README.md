3D-CNN for EEG emotion classification

Openly available framework for research purposes


## Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals
The current framework is applicable to the DEAP dataset. 
http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/


## Environment setup
The framework runs on Matlab (verified on R2019B) with the following toolboxes:

1. EEGLab
1. Deep Learning Toolbox
2. Parallel Computing Toolbox

To run the full framework, make sure the dataset is in the same folder as the files and run the 'main_project.m' file.
In this file, options (DE/PSD, normalization, etc) can be changed in the first section.
